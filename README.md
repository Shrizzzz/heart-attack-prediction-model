# Heart Attack Prediction - P3 Random Forest - Notebook.ipynb
## Description:
This project is a Machine Learning model that predicts the risk of a heart attack based on patient health parameters.

## Features
1. Uses the Random Forest Classifier for predictions.
2. Analyzes key health factors like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle factors.
3. Provides a risk score (High/Medium/Low) based on patient data.

## Project Structure
1. Dataset: Contains patient health records.
2. Data Processing: Cleans missing values and normalizes numerical data.
3. Model Training: Uses the Random Forest Classifier algorithm.
4. Evaluation: Calculates accuracy and precision scores.

## How to Use
1. Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Install dependencies (pandas, numpy, sklearn).
3. Run all cells to train the model and test predictions.

## Future Enhancements
1. Experiment with deep learning models like Neural Networks.
2. Develop a web-based health risk calculator.
3. Improve accuracy with additional patient data.
